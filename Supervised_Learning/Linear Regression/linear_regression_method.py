class SingleNeuron(object):
    """
    A class used to represent a single artificial neuron. 

    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    activation_function : function
        The activation function applied to the preactivation linear combination.

    w_ : numpy.ndarray
        The weights and bias of the single neuron. The last entry being the bias. 
        This attribute is created when the train method is called.

    errors_: list
        A list containing the mean sqaured error computed after each iteration 
        of stochastic gradient descent per epoch. 

    Methods
    -------
    train(self, X, y, alpha = 0.005, epochs = 50)
        Iterates the stochastic gradient descent algorithm through each sample 
        a total of epochs number of times with learning rate alpha. The data 
        used consists of feature vectors X and associated labels y. 

    predict(self, X)
        Uses the weights and bias, the feature vectors in X, and the 
        activation_function to make a y_hat prediction on each feature vector.
